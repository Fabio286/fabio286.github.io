I am a full-stack developer with a passion for computer science and technology.

I started my career several years ago building websites as a freelancer, mainly on LAMP stack.  
Over the years I have shifted my work to developing both frontend and backend web applications on a **JavaScript** stack.  
I have also acquired skills related to **SQL databases**, **Linux systems** management, and the AWS cloud.  
I currently develop software mainly for the electronic payments industry for transaction tracking and document digitization and archiving.  

The frameworks or technologies I work with most are **Vue.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Node.js** and **Electron.js**.  

I'm the author of [Antares SQL](https://github.com/antares-sql/antares){:target="_blank" :rel="nofollow" :class="font-bold text-orange-600 transition-colors hover:text-white"}, [Mizar TCP Tester](https://github.com/Fabio286/mizar){:target="_blank" :rel="nofollow" :class="font-bold text-orange-600 transition-colors hover:text-white"} and other open-source stuffs.
